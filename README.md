# csnim
This is a basic external cs:go cheat coded in nim. 
This is **not** a great example of an external, and the structure isn't very good either, but I made it in 2 hours with very little knowledge of nim.

It of course does however utilize reading and writing structs to reduce the number of RPMs and WPMs used, which should moderately increase performance.
I might find time to further develop this, however I am busy with university, and will not have very much free time to spend on this.

thank you to [qb-0](https://github.com/qb-0) for the [nimem](https://github.com/qb-0/Nimem) lib. I didn't have to use this, but I saw it on github and was made me want to learn a little nim.

Compile via 
> nim c main.nim

Todo:
- [] Implement remote offset updating, (i.e. hazedumper)
- [] Implement radar
- [] Implement aimbot
- [] Implement config files
- [] Implement a web-based menu (will only do this after everything else is completed)
