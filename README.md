# csnim
This is a basic external cs:go cheat coded in nim. This is not a great example of an external, and the structure isn't good either, but I made it in 2 hours with very little knowledge of nim.

thank you to [qb-0](https://github.com/qb-0) for the [nimem](https://github.com/qb-0/Nimem) lib. I didn't have to use this, but I saw it on github and was made me want to learn a little nim.

Compile via 
> nim c main.nim
Profit.
